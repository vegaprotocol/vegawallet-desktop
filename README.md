```

### Build

Compile the project using the `build` command.

```sh
wails build -p
```

If all went well, you should have a compiled program in your `build` directory.
Go to the `build` directory and run the program with `./vegawallet-desktop` or
double click `vegawallet-desktop.exe` if on Windows.
