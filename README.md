Protocol's [wallet](https://github.com/vegaprotocol/vegawallet/) for Windows, MacOS

## Development

### Dependencies

This project uses [Wails](https://wails.app) to build the desktop app. To
install Wails, follow the instruction on
its [Getting started](https://wails.app/gettingstarted/) page.

double click `vegawallet-desktop.exe` if on Windows.
