# Vega Wallet desktop frontend

The wallet app's frontend is using the generic [Vega wallet ui](https://github.com/vegaprotocol/vegawallet-ui).

### Dependencies

To run the code in this repository, you will need the following:

- nodejs >= **v18.12.0**
- yarn >= **v1.22.19**

The supported version of Typescript is **4.9.3**.

### Set up

Check you have the correct version of Node. You can [install NVM to switch between node versions](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#installing-and-updating). Then run `nvm install 18`.
If you don't already have it, install `yarn` as a global npm package by running `npm install yarn -g`.
Before you build you will need to `yarn install` in the root directory.

### Development

To be able to develop the frontend inside the desktop app, you need the following steps:

- clone the [wallet ui](https://github.com/vegaprotocol/vegawallet-ui) repo if you don't have it already
- follow the setup steps from its documentation
- link the repo by running `yarn link` in the _vegawallet-ui/libs/wallet-ui_ directory of the ui repo.
- run `yarn install` in the desktop app's _frontend_ folder
- use the linked package by running `yarn link @vegaprotocol/wallet-ui` in the _frontend_ folder of the desktop app
- run `yarn dev` in the same _frontend_ folder

_NOTES_:

- if you've previously built the frontend, make sure you removed the cached output of vite by running `rm -rf ./node_modules/.vite` in the _frontend_ folder.
- you might need to do a `yarn remove @vegaprotocol/wallet-ui && yarn add @vegaprotocol/wallet-ui`, as there's a but in the current latest version of yarn which messes with the linking.

### Code format

When you commit your changes, and create a PR, the CI runs a few checks on the code, which you can [inspect here](../.github/workflows/test-frontend.yml).

- **lint**: you can run `yarn lint:fix` to check
- **format**: you can run `yarn format:fix` to check

## Tests

The frontend runs end to end tests with cypress. The CI configuration for this is in the [same file](../.github/workflows/test-frontend.yml) as the format / lint above.
To run the end to end tests locally, you'll need to follow the following steps:

- go to the _frontend_ folder and open a terminal
- run `yarn` to get all the dependencies
- launch the desktop app by running `yarn test:dev`
- run `yarn e2e:open` to launch cypress

_NOTE_: alternatively, you can run the tests in a headless mode, too, by running `yarn e2e:run` in the _frontend_ folder.
